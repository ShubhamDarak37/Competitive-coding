## Set Matrix Zeroes:

#### Approach:

- The Elements in matrix should be made zero **Inplace**.
- The **zeroth row** and **zeroth column** are used to keep track of elements to be made zero.
- Track **Zeroth row** using **[0,0] Element** and **Zeroth column** using **separate variable**.
- For **Rows** iterate through **Zeroth Index** and for **Columns** iterate through **First Index**.
