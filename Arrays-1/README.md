# Set Matrix Zeroes:

### Approach:

- The Elements in matrix should be made zero **Inplace**.
- The **zeroth row** and **zeroth column** are used to keep track of elements to be made zero.
- Track Zeroth row using **_0,0 Element_** and Zeroth column using **separate variable**.
- For Rows iterate through **Zeroth Index** and for Cplumn's iterate through **First Index**.
